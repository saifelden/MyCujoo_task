Hello,

First I would like to thank you for sending this test, I enjoyed doing it, In the following is requirment to run this code:
- c++
- QT Creator
-  QT5 <

after running the code using the upload button upload the image and then press the other button to extract the shapes and write json file.
Note:the path that it will create the output.json inside is defined in line 150 in mainwindows.cpp please make sure to change to a path in your machine and make sure that this path already has an empy file with name output.json.

Please let me know if you found any problem during running this code.
